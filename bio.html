            <p>Hi, my name is Tim Traylor. I'm 39 years old and I'm a software developer. I grew up in Los Angeles California. I've owned a computer since I was about 5 years old. 
              Joining the US Navy at 21 and getting an opportunity to leave my small corner of America has helped me gain some perspective. During my time in the US Navy, I was able to achieve becoming a Chief Petty Officer. My time onboard submarines, as well as becoming a nuclear electrician, gave me a great appreciation for team coordination and adaptation. Being able to adapt to any and all changing conditions, staying flexible and yet determined to complete are some core principles I carry with me to today.
              After separating from the Navy in 2017, I became an electrician for King County. This job gave me a good stepping stone from the military but I quickly realized I wanted to do something different and more in line with my technical prowess and my personal goal of becoming a developer. Learning how to problem solve the code and the best way to get the intended program to work is quickly becoming my favorite way to work. 
              
              Ideally, I will be able to leverage my nuclear background, my team problem solving skills, and my love of programming to join a well established group of programmers at a job that challenges me to do things better every day.
              
              Good afternoon, my name is Tim Traylor and I am a software developer
