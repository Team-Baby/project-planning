            <h1>Keelen</h1>
            <p>Good day! My name is Keelen Fisher, born and raised in Houston Texas. I'm currently a full time student for Code Fellow's Software Development program.
              I studied Computer Science at the University of Houston Clear Lake, and I decided that I wanted to branch out and learn more about Full Stack Development
              Software Development truly excites me, from concepts of building virtual machines to applying problem solving skills like you never have before. It's all remarkable.
              I wanted to see what part of Computer Science can provide me with good ambition and never-ending developmental possibilities and
              I would love to be apart of start up companies that provide a healthy environment, then soon join large corporations and assist in big changes across the country then the world.</p>

            <p>Hi, I am Tim Traylor, an aspiring software developer. I was born in Los Angeles and grew up on a sailboat with my family, so I joined the Navy to see even more of the ocean! After 12 years as a nuclear electrician on submarines and 5 years with King County as an electrical & instrumentation supervisor, I have developed a passion for learning new skills and diving into the details with my team. I am excited to continue my journey in full stack Javascript and see where it leads.
