      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>Everyone has emotions, explaining what they are and how to handle them is the hard part. Here in the main page, you get to tell us what you've been going through. We have a list of questions to ask you about your current and recent actions as well as activities. After you've entered your responses, click on the "submit" button at the bottom to view your results!! We'll show you your emotion, along with a Playlist and Movies list that you can listen/watch based on that feeling. If you want more info, we also have our "Resources" on that same page! Want to feel different? We have a seperate list for that as well!! So what are you waiting for? Let's get started!! </p>
